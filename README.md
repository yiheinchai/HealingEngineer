# HealingEngineer
## Vision
- The vision here is that the role of doctor will shift toward Healing Engineers.
- Instead of non-scalable direct healthcare provision, Healing Engineers (with medical traning) will work to build and improve autonomous healthcare algorithms by improving and training AI systems based on latest medical research findings.
- Healing Engineers are crucial to generate the next generation AI systems which will be the main form of healthcare delivery in the future, with the aim of reduce healthcare costs by 10 000x.

## Possible projects
- Prompt engineering to teach LLMs current healthcare treatment algorithms
- [AutonomousLLMs](https://github.com/yiheinchai/AutonomousLLM) to generate and design new algorithms and more experiments that interfaces with Cloud Labs API.
- AI tooling for drug prescription, surgical treatment etc.
